# SPARK
This Repo contains the project completed during Business Analytics and Big Data´s Spark course using PySpark.


## A look into Hotels Reviews
- Data: The original data was scraped by Booking.com and they are the owners of the data, for this analysis 2017 as well as four main locations: United Kingdom, Paris, Amsterdam and Barcelona were taken into consideration.
- Methology: Through a Virtual Machine and using Spark, data transformations were done with the help of the “PySpark” library.

### Main Goal: Gain a perspective on how the customers review the different hotels, which are the best in class and the lowest rated, by location and further factors that can influence this decision: Being the main focus: Location and Reviewer Nationality. 


### Through the analysis there are three Business questions that help the reader understand the behavior of the consumers and achieve the needed actions to increase positive reviews:

- 1. Which hotels are the ones that have the best and worst score devided by location?
- 2. Which location is the one that has to watchout the most and what are my worst hotels based on the classification of goodness?
- 3. What other factor besides location and hotel type are taken into consideration for giving a good or bad review?


### Conclusions and Recomendations: 

- 1. United Kingdom the key location to keep track on since is the most visited one and the one that is between the best and worst hotel reviews.

- 2. The location with above best reviews is Barcelona, a further analysis based on the content of the reviews is advised to get the best qualities the location has and replicate them among other chains within and outside the city.

- 3. It is recommended to make the same sentiment analysis in the hotels categorized as“Alarming”since they are alarmingly below the expected average, and in order to increase the average rating and provide a good service the analysis can provide the most used words by the customer and find patterns.

- 4. Since the most vocal nationalities (UK, US, Australia and Ireland) give above all good reviews, a loyalty program is recommended towards these nationalities to promote word of mouth on the hotels, as well as an online marketing campaign targeting these nationalities.
